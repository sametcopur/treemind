Usage
======

This example demonstrates how to set up and use the ``Explainer`` with a basic ``lightgbm`` model trained on the Breast Cancer dataset. 
Note that similar configurations can be applied to other models,  ``Explainer`` is also  compatible with ``xgboost``  and ``catboost``.


For detailed information, please refer to the `API Reference <api_reference.html#api_reference>`_.

Setup Code
----------

.. code-block:: python

    from lightgbm import LGBMClassifier
    from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

    from treemind import Explainer
    from treemind.plot import (
        feature_plot,
        interaction_plot,
        interaction_scatter_plot,
    )

    # Load the dataset
    X, y = load_breast_cancer(return_X_y=True, as_frame=True)

    # Train the model
    model = LGBMClassifier(verbose=-1)
    model.fit(X, y)

Once the model is trained, it is ready to be analyzed with the ``Explainer``.

Initializing the ``Explainer``
------------------------------

After training the model, initialize the ``Explainer`` by calling it with the model object:

.. code-block:: python

    explainer = Explainer()
    explainer(model)

Counting Feature Appearances 
----------------------------

The ``count_node`` function analyzes how often individual features or pairs of features appear in decision splits across the model's trees. This analysis can help identify the most influential features or feature interactions in the model's decision-making process.

To count individual feature appearances in splits:

.. code-block:: python

    explainer.count_node(order=1)

.. code-block:: text

    | column_index | count |
    |--------------|-------|
    | 21           | 1739  |
    | 27           | 1469  |
    | 22           | 1422  |
    | 23           | 1323  |
    | 1            | 1129  |



To count feature-pair interactions in splits:

.. code-block:: python

    explainer.count_node(order=2)

.. code-block:: text

    | column1_index | column2_index | count |
    |---------------|---------------|-------|
    | 21            | 22            | 927   |
    | 21            | 23            | 876   |
    | 21            | 27            | 852   |
    | 1             | 27            | 792   |
    | 23            | 27            | 734   |



Analyzing Specific Feature
----------------------------

The ``analyze_feature`` function calculates statistical metrics for a specific feature based on its split points across the model's trees. 
This analysis helps in understanding the distribution and impact of a single feature across different split points.


To analyze a specific feature by its index (e.g., 21), use:

.. code-block:: python

    feature_df = explainer.analyze_feature(21)

.. code-block:: text

    | worst_texture_lb | worst_texture_ub |   value   |   std    |  count  |
    |------------------|------------------|-----------|----------|---------|
    | -inf             | 18.460           | 3.185128  | 8.479232 | 402.24  |
    | 18.460           | 19.300           | 3.160656  | 8.519873 | 402.39  |
    | 19.300           | 19.415           | 3.119814  | 8.489262 | 401.85  |
    | 19.415           | 20.225           | 3.101601  | 8.490439 | 402.55  |
    | 20.225           | 20.360           | 2.772929  | 8.711773 | 433.16  |



To visualize feature statistics calculated by ``analyze_feature`` using ``feature_plot``:

.. code-block:: python

    feature_plot(feature_df)

.. image:: _static/example/feature_plot.png
    :alt: Feature plot visualizing statistical metrics for a feature
    :align: center
    :width: 80%

The ``feature_plot`` function plots the values of a specific feature based on split points across trees.

Analyzing Feature Interactions
------------------------------

The ``analyze_feature`` function given multiple indices calculates the dependency between two or more features by examining their split points across the modelâ€™s trees. 

To analyze an interaction between two features (e.g., feature indices 21 and 22), use:

.. code-block:: python

    df = explainer.analyze_feature([21, 22])

Example output:

.. code-block:: text

    | worst_texture_lb | worst_texture_ub | worst_concave_points_lb | worst_concave_points_ub |   value   |   std    |  count  |
    |------------------|------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|----------|---------|
    | -inf             | 18.46            | -inf                    | 0.058860                | 4.929324  | 7.679424 | 355.40  |
    | -inf             | 18.46            | 0.058860                | 0.059630                | 4.928594  | 7.679772 | 355.34  |
    | -inf             | 18.46            | 0.059630                | 0.065540                | 4.923128  | 7.679783 | 355.03  |
    | -inf             | 18.46            | 0.065540                | 0.069320                | 4.912888  | 7.682064 | 354.70  |
    | -inf             | 18.46            | 0.069320                | 0.069775                | 4.912888  | 7.682064 | 354.70  |



To visualize interactions between two features calculated by ``analyze_interaction`` using ``interaction_plot``:

.. code-block:: python

    interaction_plot(df)

.. image:: _static/example/interaction_plot.png
    :alt: Interaction plot visualizing dependencies between two features
    :align: center
    :width: 80%

The ``interaction_plot`` function visualizes feature interactions by creating a filled rectangle plot. The plot uses model split points to 
display intervals, with color intensity representing the interaction values.

To visualize interactions between two features on given data by ``analyze_interaction`` using ``interaction_scatter_plot``:

.. code-block:: python

    interaction_scatter_plot(X, df, 21, 22)

.. image:: _static/example/interaction_scatter_plot.png
    :alt: Interaction plot visualizing dependencies between two features
    :align: center
    :width: 80%

The ``interaction_scatter_plot`` function visualizes feature interactions reflected on given data.
