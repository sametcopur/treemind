API Reference
=============

treemind consists of two main components: the ``Explainer`` class and the ``plot`` functions. All plot functions operate based on 
the outputs of the ``Explainer`` class. The ``Explainer`` class returns results in formats like numpy arrays, pandas DataFrames, 
or lists, making it simple and free from complexity.
